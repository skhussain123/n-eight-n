n8n (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is an open‑source workflow automation, Agentic AI, and orchestration platform. It lets you build AI Agents and connect APIs, databases, and services with a visual, node‑based editor, while still giving you the power to drop into code when you need it. For agentic AI, that combination—no‑code orchestration with just‑enough code—makes n8n an ideal control plane for prototyping and building systems that can perceive, plan, and act across tools.

### What are AI Agents?
!["AI Agents"](./agent.png)<br>

LLM (the brain) + tools/APIs (hands) + memory (long-term context) + goals (what to achieve) + a loop (to try, check, and try again).



### What n8n is (in agent terms)
n8n is a visual workflow orchestrator. You drag-and-drop nodes to let an AI model (the “brain”) use tools (APIs, databases, vector stores), manage memory, and include humans when needed. In other words, you build agents that can perceive → decide → act across your stack. n8n ships AI/LLM nodes (OpenAI, embeddings, chat), tool nodes (HTTP Request, Slack, etc.), and “agent” patterns out of the box.


### Mental model (simple)
---
1. Trigger (manual, schedule, webhook, Slack).
2. Plan/decide (LLM node).
3. Act (tool nodes like HTTP, DB, Drive, Slack).
4. Remember (Chat Memory / vector store).
5. Verify/HITL (approval or guardrail step).
6. Loop until the goal is met or a stop condition is reached.

### Common use cases for beginners
* AI helpdesk or chatbot that reads docs (vector store), answers, and escalates to a human on low confidence. ([n8n Docs][3])
* Report generator: fetch API/DB data (HTTP), summarize with LLM, export CSV/XLSX, send to Slack/email with an approval step. ([n8n Docs][6])
* Research assistant: scrape pages, chunk & embed to Pinecone/Qdrant, then chat over the corpus. ([n8n Docs][9])


#### No-Code, Low-code, and Full-code
!["AI Agents"](./compare.jpg)<br>
Agentic AI platforms can be introduced as a continuum—no-code, low-code, and full-code—that aligns delivery speed with architectural control as solutions mature. No-code platforms provide visual builders, templates, and managed connectors so non-developers can assemble agent workflows quickly and safely. Low-code platforms retain a visual canvas but add programmable “escape hatches” (custom logic, APIs, components) to handle real-world variability while preserving rapid iteration for internal tools and orchestration. Full-code platforms expose full SDKs and runtime control, enabling engineers to implement bespoke agent behaviors, enforce testing and observability, integrate with existing services, and meet performance, security, and compliance requirements. A pragmatic adoption path for developers is to ideate in low-code for fastest validation and prototying,and graduate the durable or business-critical workloads to full-code for long-term reliability and scale.

Here’s a crisp way to tell them apart and know when to use which.

### What they are
* No-code: Visual app builders for non-developers—think drag-and-drop UI, built-in data, and “recipes” for logic.
* Low-code: Visual + code “escape hatches”—faster than full code, but you can script/extend when needed.
* Full-code: Everything is coded by engineers—maximum control, minimum guardrails, longest runway.

### Side-by-side

| Dimension               | No-code                            | Low-code                              | Full-code                                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary users**       | Business users, analysts           | Devs + prototypers + power users                    | Software engineers                                  |
| **Speed to MVP**        | Fastest                            | Fast                                  | Slowest                                             |
| **UI/Logic**            | Drag-and-drop + prebuilt actions   | Visual flows + custom code blocks     | Hand-coded UI, APIs, logic                          |
| **Data**                | Built-in tables/connectors         | Connectors + custom integrations      | Any database or data layer you choose               |
| **Extensibility**       | Limited to vendor features         | Plugins, scripts, custom components   | Unlimited (your stack, your rules)                  |
| **DevOps/CI/CD**        | Vendor-managed                     | Partial (some pipelines)              | You own CI/CD, testing, infra                       |
| **Compliance/Gov**      | Varies by vendor                   | Stronger enterprise options           | You design for your needs                           |

| **Vendor lock-in**      | Highest                            | Medium                                | Lowest                                              |
| **Cost profile**        | Per-user/app fees                  | Platform + dev time                   | Infra + engineering time                            |
| **Typical examples**    | Zapier + Airtable + Google Opal | n8n | React/Next.js + FastAPI +  Open AI Agents SDK |


#### When to pick which
* Choose no-code when non-devs need quick CRUD apps, forms, simple workflows, prototypes, or microsites, and tight deadlines matter more than perfect fit.
* Choose low-code when you want speed and the option to drop in real code—internal tools, admin consoles, workflow automation, line-of-business apps with a few custom bits.
* Choose full-code when you need bespoke UX, complex logic, high performance, strict security/compliance, deep integrations, or plan to scale into a product with a long lifecycle.


#### Where does n8n stand in the spectrum
Short answer: n8n is firmly “low-code”—a developer-friendly automation/workflow platform that sits between no-code tools (Zapier and Make) and full-code (Python and OpenAI Agents SDK).


#### Why low-code?
* Visual flows for 80–90% of logic.
* Code escape hatches (Function/Code nodes, expressions) when you need JS/Python, custom auth, or odd transforms.
* Self-hostable & open source, so lower vendor lock-in than typical no-code.

In the category as open-source, low-code platforms with agent features, n8n is clearly in the top tier and growing extremely fast.
* n8n’s GitHub stars jumped from 75k on Apr 8, 2025 to 100k by May 28, 2025—a big surge in ~7 weeks.
* n8n has leaned hard into AI agents (native “AI Agent” node, multi-agent orchestration, docs and templates), so growth is tied to agentic use cases—not just classic automation.

### Our Agentic AI Stack: n8n and OpenAI Agents SDK
We’re standardizing on n8n for the low-code layer and the OpenAI Agents SDK for the full-code layer because both are showing exceptional, category-specific growth, are open source, self-hostable, and run cleanly in containers on Kubernetes across any cloud—giving developers a fast visual surface for prototyping and a rigorously testable codebase for production. Critically, both align on the Model Context Protocol (MCP): n8n provides a built-in MCP Client Tool node to consume tools from external MCP servers and publishes guidance/templates for exposing n8n workflows as an MCP server, enabling the same tool surface in visual automations. On the full-code side, the OpenAI Agents SDK offers first-class MCP support. This shared MCP foundation lets us move prototypes to production with minimal rework: the same MCP servers (filesystems, web research, internal APIs, etc.) can be exercised from n8n during rapid iteration and then wired directly into Agents SDK–based services as they harden—keeping interfaces stable while we scale.

Practically, we prototype in n8n to validate data models and agent behaviors, lock down webhook/API contracts, and capture human-in-the-loop steps; then we codify in the Agents SDK for performance, reliability, and compliance, while continuing to use n8n for ops automations and glue. The result is speed where it matters and rigor where it counts—the path from whiteboard to production without reinventing the pen every week.

In short: we bet on the winners in each category to move faster now and scale safely later—speed where it matters.
